- Conditional Statements (if, elif, else)
- Loops (for, while), `range()`, `enumerate()`
- Basic error handling: `try-except`
- Introduction to functions
- Built-in functions: `len()`, `type()`, `int()`, `str()`
  
**Real-World Examples:**
- Calculator App
- Temperature Converter
- Grade Analyzer

**Project:**

“Student Management Console App”
Input and manage student records (CRUD in memory), calculate GPA, etc.

### 📗 Month 3: Object-Oriented Programming + Testing
#### 🎯 Objective: Learn OOP principles and write testable Python code.

**Topics:**
- Classes and Objects
- `__init__`, `self`, instance vs class variables
- Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism
- Special Methods (`__str__`, `__repr__`, etc.)
- Exception Handling (custom exceptions)
